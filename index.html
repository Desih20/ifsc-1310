    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is making sure the content on a web site is high quality on all different browsers and different devices. The importance of progressive enhancement helps developers' websites be accessed in different areas. It also protects the developers' craft from being changed. Since new technology keeps getting created, progressive enhancement should be used among modern developers.</p>
    <h2>Centaur Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project was fun, yet challenging. Building a webpage for a company or small business takes time. When I was working on this project, I was trying to think of a design and color scheme for Segway. I had to look at the logo to see if I can find inspiration or a clue. It took some time, but it was soon resolved. I also had issues trying to make the images appear on the site. To be honest, I didn't know how to begin this project. I had a plan, but I didn't know how to start. Until I attended the live sessions with my professor and rewatched videos, I was no longer lost. This semester I enjoyed learning about html, css, and js. The live sessions were fun and helpful. I really liked how my professor recommended us websites and other resources to use for assignments, especially when we were just beginning to use css. The assignments were not stressful at all; however, they were time consuming. At first, I was ahead in this class. Then, I was behind. Now I am little ahead. Sadly, I wish we could have got to javascript (js) before December. Overall, this semester was good.</p>
    <p>The things I did well this semester was figuring out what I did wrong in my code and fixing those mistakes. If I had to start over, the only thing I would do differently is how I handle projects and assignments. Every time there was an assignment I had no confidence in getting it done. Instead of repeating this, I will find other websites I can use to help me practice and develop new skills in writing html, css, and js whenever I am free.</p>
    <p>The feedback I received on my first attempt at creating the webpage for Segway Centaur was it was missing color and design. It was also stated that my Segway Centaur webpage looked unfinished, but the way the information was presented was good. On my first attempt, I had trouble seeing my design I created for the webpage. The problem was solved when I forgot to add a css stylesheet to the index. Then, I ran into another problem this time with the images. The images would not appear on the webpage. This problem was solved once I figured out I had to crop all the images exactly the same size. Then, I had to upload them all underneath the img folder. Lastly, I referenced them each and the images were finally showing on the webpage.</p>
